#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Every workflow that runs a script must name the shell it wrote that script in.
#
# GitHub reads the shell off the runner when a step does not name one: bash on
# Linux and macOS, PowerShell on Windows. Every `run:` block in this repository
# is bash — `[ -n "$X" ]`, arrays, `+=`, `>> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"` — so a caller
# that points RUNS_ON at a Windows runner gets a parse error where a run should
# be, not a different-but-working shell.
#
# That is not hypothetical. test-go.yml takes a RUNNERS matrix precisely so a
# suite can be tried on a second operating system; the first caller to name
# windows-latest had its step handed to pwsh, which stopped at the first
# `if [ -n "$TEST_PRECOMMAND" ]` with "Missing '(' after 'if'". The job failed
# in 37 seconds having tested nothing, and nothing in the workflow said why.
#
# 31 of these workflows take a RUNS_ON input, so this was one caller's choice
# away in almost all of them; test-go.yml was simply the first anyone pointed
# somewhere else.
#
# `bash` is the portable value rather than a Linux one: GitHub resolves it to
# Git Bash on Windows and to /usr/bin/bash elsewhere. It is not offered as an
# input for the same reason it is not a preference — the scripts *are* bash, so
# the other values are not alternatives, they are failures, and they fail on
# exactly the runner nobody tests on.
#
# Declared once per file rather than per step: a step added later would
# otherwise reintroduce this silently, which is how it would come back.
